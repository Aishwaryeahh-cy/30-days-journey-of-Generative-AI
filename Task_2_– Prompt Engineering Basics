Tool of the Day: PromptPerfect – refine prompts for better results.

📘 Theory 
1. Zero-shot prompting
You give the AI a task without any examples.
AI guesses your style & format by itself.

2. Few-shot prompting
You give the AI some examples first, then ask it to continue in the same style.
Example:  Roses are red, skies are blue,
Poetry is sweet, and so are you.  

3. Role-based prompts
You tell the AI to “act as” someone.
Example: “Act as a professional storyteller. Write a bedtime story for kids about a talking tree.”
This makes AI’s response more focused.
