Tool of the Day: Canva AI – create AI art.

Theory 

Diffusion Models → Fancy name, but think of it like this:
Imagine a messy page full of dots (like TV noise 📺). AI slowly “cleans” it step by step until a clear picture appears.

Stable Diffusion / MidJourney → These are tools where you type what you want → they make a picture.

Example:
Type → “A cat wearing a crown sitting on a golden throne.”
AI draws exactly that 🐱👑.
